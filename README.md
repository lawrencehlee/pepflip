# UCSD Pepband's Pepflip

This is a small Windows batch script that automatically generates doubled, flipped ("pepflipped") pdfs from your full- or half-page music.

Prerequisites:

- Windows
- [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
- [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/)

Usage:

- Make sure you fulfill the prereqs.
- Download the batch file (pepflip.bat) and put it in the same directory as your pdfs.
- Double-click the file to run it.
- Your resulting pepflipped pdfs will be in the "pepflipped" directory. Note that any files of the same name in that directory will be overwritten!
